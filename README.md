### Built with

- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

it was quite challenging but i learnt a lot about the position: relative and position absolute properties,
and they were instrumental in creating this design. I did try to get it to look as close to the design as possible.
### Continued development

I would love to learn how to be much more efficient in using css properites, and dramtically reduce the amount of code.
